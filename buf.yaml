# Modules now share a common set of dependencies. This was the major concern with the v1
# buf.work.yaml and v1 buf.yaml setup - every module had its own (potentially conflicting)
# set of dependencies, which made simultaneously pushing the modules impossible, and led
# many commands within the buf CLI to effectively mash the dependencies together in ways
# not exposed to users.
#
# There will be a single buf.lock file produced, which lives alongside this buf.yaml.
